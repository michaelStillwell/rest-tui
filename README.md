# `rest-tui`

Are you tired of writing out long `curl` commands? Don't want to go through the 4 minutes of starting
up Postman? Well do I have a product for you: `rest-tui`!

> name is a work in progress

### Roadmap

- [ ] configurable keybinds
- [ ] edit query parameters
- [ ] edit cookies/headers
- [?] file configs for request groups
    - will definitely need more thinking about how that'll look and work
- [ ] TBD

### Installation

This is just another `go` project, so you probably know how to install. But here is the command I ran:

```bash
go build -o rest .
```

And then you're free to move it to your form of `PATH` as you see fit.
